- play random music cues for no reason
- shiny bluefruit (sort of like emerald's tweaks and features)(DONE i think)
- poisonous green bluefruit
- need more random features
- make game freezing on capture optional
- don't chase players that are in pipes
- can sometimes crash when choosing entrance
- "stalker" behavior for It
- violencing It stuns it for a bit
- idea: remix config tabs for each level of spookiness
